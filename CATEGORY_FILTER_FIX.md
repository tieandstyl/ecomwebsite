# Category Page Filter Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Subcategory Filter Not Showing Selected Products
**Problem:** When clicking a subcategory filter, the page would reload but the filtered products weren't displaying properly.

**Solution:** 
- The filter logic was already correctly implemented in the JavaScript
- The issue was that the `currentSubcategory` variable was being set during page load from URL parameters
- The filtering logic in `renderProducts()` function was checking for `currentSubcategory` and properly filtering products
- Added call to `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` in `renderProducts()` to ensure UI stays in sync

### 2. Added Remove Filter Functionality
**Problem:** No way to remove individual filters without clearing all filters or reloading the page.

**Solution:**
Added a new "Active Filters" section that displays all currently active filters with individual remove buttons:

#### New Features Added:

1. **Active Filters Display Section** (in HTML)
   - Shows all active filters in badges with × buttons
   - Located at the top of the filters sidebar
   - Hidden when no filters are active
   - "Clear All" button at the top of filters section

2. **Individual Filter Remove Functions** (in JavaScript)
   - `removePriceFilter(range)` - Removes a specific price range filter
   - `removeStockFilter()` - Removes the in-stock filter
   - `clearSubcategoryFilter()` - Already existed, clears subcategory filter

3. **Active Filter Display Management**
   - `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` - Updates the active filters UI
   - Automatically called when:
     - Subcategory filters are rendered
     - Filters are applied
     - Filters are cleared
     - Products are rendered

## Changes Made

### HTML Changes (category.html)
```html
<!-- Added at line 87-95 -->
<div class="flex items-center justify-between mb-4">
  <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-stone-900 dark:text-stone-100">Filters</h3>
  <button class="text-xs text-primary hover:underline font-semibold" onclick="clearAllFilters()">Clear All</button>
</div>

<!-- Active Filters Display -->
<div id="activeFiltersSection" class="mb-4 hidden">
  <div class="text-xs font-semibold text-stone-600 dark:text-stone-400 mb-2">Active:</div>
  <div id="activeFiltersList" class="flex flex-wrap gap-2"></div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Changes (js/category.js)

1. **Updated `renderSubcategoryFilters()` function**
   - Added call to `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` at the end

2. **Added `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` function**
   - Collects all active filters (subcategory, price, stock)
   - Renders them as removable badges
   - Hides section when no filters are active

3. **Added `removePriceFilter()` function**
   - Removes specific price filter
   - Updates checkbox state
   - Refreshes products display

4. **Added `removeStockFilter()` function**
   - Removes stock availability filter
   - Resets dropdown to "All"
   - Refreshes products display

5. **Updated `applyFilters()` function**
   - Added call to `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()`

6. **Updated `clearAllFilters()` function**
   - Now also clears availability filter dropdown
   - Added call to `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()`

7. **Updated `renderProducts()` function**
   - Added call to `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` to keep UI in sync

## How It Works

1. **Subcategory Filtering:**
   - When user clicks a subcategory radio button, `filterBySubcategory()` is called
   - URL is updated with subcategory parameter and page reloads
   - On page load, `loadCategories()` reads the subcategory from URL
   - `currentSubcategory` is set and used in `renderProducts()` to filter products

2. **Active Filters Display:**
   - After any filter change, `updateActiveFiltersDisplay()` is called
   - Function checks all active filters (subcategory, price ranges, stock)
   - Creates badge for each active filter with remove button
   - Shows/hides the active filters section based on whether any filters are active

3. **Individual Filter Removal:**
   - Each active filter badge has a × button
   - Clicking it calls the appropriate remove function
   - Remove function updates the filter state and UI
   - Products are automatically re-rendered without page reload

## Testing Instructions

1. Open `category.html` with a category parameter (e.g., `category.html?category=accessories`)
2. Test subcategory filter:
   - Click a subcategory radio button
   - Verify products are filtered correctly
   - Check that the subcategory appears in "Active Filters" section
3. Test price filters:
   - Check one or more price range checkboxes
   - Verify products are filtered
   - Check that price ranges appear in "Active Filters"
4. Test individual removal:
   - Click × button on any active filter badge
   - Verify that specific filter is removed
   - Verify products update correctly
5. Test "Clear All":
   - Apply multiple filters
   - Click "Clear All" button
   - Verify all filters are removed and all products are shown

## Notes

- The subcategory filter works by reloading the page with URL parameters (maintains state on page reload)
- Price and stock filters work without page reload (JavaScript-based filtering)
- The filtering is cumulative (products must match ALL active filters)
- The active filters display provides visual feedback of current filter state
