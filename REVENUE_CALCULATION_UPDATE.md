# ✅ Revenue Calculation Updated

## What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
// Calculated revenue from ALL orders (pending, confirmed, failed)
const todayRevenue = todayOrders.reduce((sum, order) => {
  return sum + (order.totals?.total || 0);
}, 0);
```

### After:
```javascript
// Calculates revenue ONLY from confirmed payments
const todayRevenue = todayOrders.reduce((sum, order) => {
  // Only add to revenue if payment is confirmed
  if (order.paymentStatus === 'confirmed') {
    return sum + (order.totals?.total || 0);
  }
  return sum;
}, 0);
```

## Impact

### Admin Dashboard - Today's Revenue Card

**OLD Behavior:**
```
Today's Revenue
💰
₹2,500.00  ← Shows total from ALL orders (even unpaid)
```

**NEW Behavior:**
```
Today's Revenue
💰
₹1,200.00  ← Shows total ONLY from confirmed payments
```

## Example Scenario

**Today's Orders:**
1. Order #1: ₹500 - Payment Status: **Confirmed** ✅
2. Order #2: ₹800 - Payment Status: **Confirmed** ✅
3. Order #3: ₹600 - Payment Status: **Pending** ⏳
4. Order #4: ₹400 - Payment Status: **Failed** ❌

**OLD Calculation:**
```
Revenue = ₹500 + ₹800 + ₹600 + ₹400 = ₹2,300
Shows: ₹2,300.00
```

**NEW Calculation (Confirmed Only):**
```
Revenue = ₹500 + ₹800 = ₹1,300
Shows: ₹1,300.00
```
