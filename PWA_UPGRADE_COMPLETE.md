## How It Works

### Cart System
```javascript

addToCart(sku, title, price, image)

// Cart stored in localStorage
localStorage: 'whshop_cart_v1'

// Updates across all pages
// Badge shows item count
```

### Profile System
```javascript
// Save profile
saveProfile(userData)

// Stored in localStorage
localStorage: 'whshop_profile_v1'

// Pre-fills checkout forms
// Order history tracked
localStorage: 'whshop_orders_v1'
```

### PWA Installation
1. User visits site
2. Browser prompts "Add to Home Screen"
3. App installs like native app
