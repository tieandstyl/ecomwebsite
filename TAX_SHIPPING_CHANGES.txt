# ✅ COMPLETED: Tax Removed & Store.json Shipping Integration

## What Was Changed

### ❌ OLD BEHAVIOR (Hardcoded):
```javascript
// OLD - checkout.js & cart.js
const shipping = subtotal >= 500 ? 0 : 60;  // Fixed values
const tax = Math.round(subtotal * 0.05);     // 5% tax always
```

### ✅ NEW BEHAVIOR (Dynamic from store.json):
```javascript
// NEW - checkout.js & cart.js
const freeShippingMin = store?.pricing?.freeShippingMin || 999;  // From JSON
const shippingFlat = store?.pricing?.shippingFlat || 50;         // From JSON
const shipping = subtotal >= freeShippingMin ? 0 : shippingFlat;
const tax = 0;  // REMOVED
```

## Current Settings (from store.json)

```json
"pricing": {
  "taxRatePct": 0.0,           ← Tax is 0% (removed)
  "freeShippingMin": 999.0,    ← Free shipping at ₹999
  "shippingFlat": 50.0         ← Flat rate ₹50
}
```
