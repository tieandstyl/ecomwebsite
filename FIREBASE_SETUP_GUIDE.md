## 🔐 Firebase Security Setup Required

**IMPORTANT:** You need to set up Firebase Authentication and Firestore rules:

### Step 1: Enable Email/Password Authentication
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **tiestyle-369c7**
3. Go to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Email/Password** authentication
5. Add your first admin user:
   - Email: admin@tiestyle.com
   - Password: admin123 (or your preferred password)

### Step 2: Create Firestore Database
1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Start in **production mode** (we'll add rules next)
4. Choose your region (closest to your users)

### Step 3: Set Up Firestore Security Rules
Go to **Firestore Database** > **Rules** and paste this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Orders collection - public write, admin read
    match /orders/{orderId} {
      // Allow anyone to create orders (from checkout)
      allow create: if true;
      
      // Only authenticated admin users can read/update orders
      allow read, update: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Deny all other access
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Set Up Firestore Indexes (Optional but Recommended)
If you get index errors, Firebase will provide a link to create them automatically. Common indexes needed:

1. **Collection:** orders
   - Fields: `customer.phone` (Ascending), `createdAt` (Descending)
   
2. **Collection:** orders
   - Fields: `createdAt` (Ascending), `status` (Ascending)

## 📊 Database Structure

### Orders Collection (`orders`)
```javascript
{
  orderId: "ORD-1234567890",
  customer: {
    name: "John Doe",
    phone: "+91234567890",
    email: "john@example.com",
    address: "123 Street",
    address2: "Apt 4B",
    city: "Mumbai",
    state: "Maharashtra",
    zip: "400001",
    notes: "Leave at door"
  },
  items: [
    {
      title: "Product Name",
      price: 299.00,
      quantity: 2,
      image: "path/to/image.jpg"
    }
  ],
  totals: {
    subtotal: 598.00,
    shipping: 59.00,
    tax: 29.90,
    total: 686.90
  },
  status: "pending", // pending, processing, completed, cancelled
  paymentMethod: "UPI",
  paymentStatus: "pending",
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp
}
